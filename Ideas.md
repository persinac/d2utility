# IDEAS / TODO
## TODO
- Numero Uno => Transcribe the API server from vanilla JS to TS
- Push code onto non-local machine...
    - This means setting up the server, securing the server, and a whole host of shit
- DB expansion
    - per guildId
    - player names => id's
    - Players per server? Not sure if add any value, but maybe 
## Ideas
